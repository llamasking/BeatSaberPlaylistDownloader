# BeatSaverPlaylistDownloader

A Python script that takes a list of songs and automatically searches for and downloads them off BeatSaver.

## How do you use it?

1. Give it a text file with the name of each song you want to download on it's own line.

```
song1
someone - song2
song3 (kill me remix)
...
```

2. Fill out config.ini.

3. Run download.py. Everything will be in the folder specified.
