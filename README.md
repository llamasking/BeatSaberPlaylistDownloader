# BeatSaverPlaylistDownloader

A Python script that takes a list of songs and automatically searches for and downloads them off BeatSaver.

## How do you use it?

1. Give it a text file with the name of each song you want to download on it's own line. For example:

```
Generic Song Name
Generic Author - Generic Song Name
Generic Song Name (Python Sucks Remix)
...
```

2. Fill out config.ini. Each option is explained in there.

3. Run download.py. Everything will be in the folder specified.
